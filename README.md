This project aims to apply various techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to solve a real life problem, namely using Twitter sentiment to predict share price movements. An end-to-end pipeline, including data collection, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, as well as price prediction, has been implemented, based on extensive experiments with various Machine Learning techniques and existing NLP tools. Further improvement opportunities have also been identified to enhance the current prototype, especially the price prediction model would benefit from accumulation of more data over a longer period of time.
